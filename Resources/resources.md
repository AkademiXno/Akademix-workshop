# Resources

Here are some resources you can use to create a mini-course. The focus of the workshop is not on the content, but on creating a course structure. *You shouldn't worry to much about creating an interesting course* (you can do that later).

The resources can perhaps also be a source of inspiration when you're creating your own videos.

<h2>What should I know before starting biology?<h2>

<p>
If you are curious about biology or plan to study it in the future, you may be wondering what 
"prerequisites" it has – that is, what other knowledge will give you a solid foundation to 
learn biology. If so, big kudos for thinking ahead!
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, the only strict prereqs for biology are curiosity, an open mind, and a 
willingness to think critically about the natural world. If you have those, you can start 
learning biology without other background, as long as you're willing to pick up bits of 
chemistry, physics, statistics, and math along the way.
</p>

<p>
That said, you may find your journey through biology smoother and more satisfying if you 
already have some familiarity with topics in other areas, particularly chemistry. Below are 
some foundational topics that will help you get the most out of Khan Academy's biology materials 
(or any biology class).
</p>

<h3>General science skills</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> 
  The scientific method. Are you rusty on what a hypothesis is or how it gets tested? 
  How about experiments? These basic concepts will help you not only in biology, but 
  also in any other area of science!
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Chemistry</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> 
General chemistry. Get a feel for atoms, molecules, and how they interact with each other.
After all, that's what you (and all life) are made up of!
  </li>
  <li>
Acid-base chemistry. A lot of the chemistry in your body is acid-base chemistry that takes
place in watery solutions. Knowing what acids and bases are will get you a long way with
biochemistry.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Physics</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
 Laws of thermodynamics. Get a feeling for what energy is and what rules govern its transfer.
 Energy is constantly flowing through ecosystems, organisms, and cells, and is essential to
 keep these systems running!
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/what-is-biology/a/what-is-life
```
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the intro to biology video, we defined biology as the branch of science concerned with
the study of living things, or organisms. That definition is pretty straightforward.
However, it opens the door to more difficult—and more interesting—questions: What is life?
What does it mean to be alive?
</p>

<p>
You are alive, and so am I. The dog I can hear barking is alive, and so is the tree outside
my window. However, snow falling from the clouds is not alive. The computer you’re using to
read this article is not alive, and neither is a chair or table. The parts of a chair that
are made of wood were once alive, but they aren’t any longer. If you were to burn the wood
in a fire, the fire would not be alive either.
</p>

<p>
What is it that defines life? How can we tell that one thing is alive and another is not?
Most people have an intuitive understanding of what it means for something to be alive.
However, it’s surprisingly hard to come up with a precise definition of life. Because of this,
many definitions of life are operational definitions—they allow us to separate living things
from nonliving ones, but they don’t actually pin down what life is. To make this separation,
we must come up with a list of properties that are, as a group, uniquely characteristic of
living organisms.

```
<h3>Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs</h3>

<h4>Make sure you can access the command line</h4>

<p>If you are on Windows, you’ll need to install some software in order to
use a unix-like command line (different from the Windows built-in
Command Prompt), as we mentioned previously. For more info, check out this page.</p>

<h4>Choose a text editor</h4>

<p>As noted in the previous video, you should make sure to use a simple text editor
like Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim, etc. and not a rich-text editor like
Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, so that you can easily look at your files' content
on the command line.
</p>

<p>If you don’t have one that you like yet, Sublime is a good option that will work on Windows,
Mac, and Linux. We have provided more detailed instructions for setting up Sublime than for
other editors, and we use Sublime for all the examples in the course. You can download Sublime here.
</p>

<h4>Make sure you can launch your editor from the command line</h4>
<p>It will be helpful to be able to launch your text editor from the command line.
See here for instructions on how to do this for Sublime. If you have trouble getting
this working, videos at the end of the lesson called "Setting up Your Workspace on 
Windows" and "Setting Up Your Workspace on Mac" will demonstrate this process, so
you can wait until then.
</p>

<h4>Set up your course workspace</h4>
<p>Right now, you should create a version-control directory (a more computer-science-y
term for “folder”) to hold all your files for this course in an easy to remember
location, then create a reflections sub-directory, and within that, create a plain
text file called lesson_1_reflections.txt for the questions from this lesson.
</p>

<p>You can do this by running the following commands in either Git Bash or the terminal
(the bits after the # signs are comments, anything after those are not interpreted):</p>

<p>
cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt
(you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)
If you prefer, rather than creating the file from scratch, you could download the
lesson_1_reflections_prompts.txt file from the Downloadables section, place it in the
reflections directory and rename it, then add your response after the first prompt.
</p>

<h3>Purpose of the problem set</h3>

<p>
The questions in this problem set are designed not only to give extra practice with the
concepts from Lesson 1, but also to help you deepen your understanding of those concepts.
Some of the questions will be tricky, and you're not expected to get every question right
on the first try. The purpose is for you to learn, so have fun!

```

#### Exercise 2:
Create a multiple choice problem and paste the following text:

```
>>Hvilket av følgend utsagn er sant?<<
( ) Planter lager oksygen via fotosyntese, som så brukes av mennesker i cellulær respirasjon 
( ) Mennesker kan danne oksygen via cellulær respirasjon {{ Mennesker kan ikke produsere oksygen 
da det er et produkt av fotosyntese.}}
(x) Oksygen opptrer naturlig og behøver ikke syntetiseres
