### Key points

The law of demand states that a higher price leads to a lower quantity demanded and that a lower price leads to a higher quantity demanded.
Demand curves and demand schedules are tools used to summarize the relationship between demand and price.
Demand for goods and services

Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay, you have no effective demand.
What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand are held constant.


### Demand schedule and demand curve

A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price.
A demand curve is a graph that shows the quantity demanded at each price.
Here's an example of a demand schedule from the market for gasoline.
Price (per gallon)	Quantity demanded (millions of gallons)
\$1.00$1.00dollar sign, 1, point, 00	800800800
\$1.20$1.20dollar sign, 1, point, 20	700700700
\$1.40$1.40dollar sign, 1, point, 40	600600600
\$1.60$1.60dollar sign, 1, point, 60	550550550
\$1.80$1.80dollar sign, 1, point, 80	500500500
\$2.00$2.00dollar sign, 2, point, 00	460460460
\$2.20$2.20dollar sign, 2, point, 20	420420420
Price, in this case, is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline. The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period—for example, per day or per year—and over some geographic area—like a state or a country.
Here's the same information shown as a demand curve with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (xxx) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (yyy) goes on the vertical.

[Demand curve](law_demand_fig.jpg)

The graph shows a downward-sloping demand curve that represents the law of demand.
The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. These points are then graphed, and the line connecting them is the demand curve. The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.
Demand curves will be somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, and they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left to right, embodying the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and, conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.

### The difference between demand and quantity demanded

In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve, and quantity demanded refers to a specific point on the curve.

Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs
Make sure you can access the command line
If you are on Windows, you’ll need to install some software in order to use a unix-like command line (different from the Windows built-in Command Prompt), as we mentioned previously. For more info, check out this page.

Choose a text editor
As noted in the previous video, you should make sure to use a simple text editor like Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim, etc. and not a rich-text editor like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, so that you can easily look at your files' content on the command line.

If you don’t have one that you like yet, Sublime is a good option that will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. We have provided more detailed instructions for setting up Sublime than for other editors, and we use Sublime for all the examples in the course. You can download Sublime here.

Make sure you can launch your editor from the command line
It will be helpful to be able to launch your text editor from the command line. See here for instructions on how to do this for Sublime. If you have trouble getting this working, videos at the end of the lesson called "Setting up Your Workspace on Windows" and "Setting Up Your Workspace on Mac" will demonstrate this process, so you can wait until then.

Set up your course workspace
Right now, you should create a version-control directory (a more computer-science-y term for “folder”) to hold all your files for this course in an easy to remember location, then create a reflections sub-directory, and within that, create a plain text file called lesson_1_reflections.txt for the questions from this lesson.

You can do this by running the following commands in either Git Bash or the terminal (the bits after the # signs are comments, anything after those are not interpreted):

cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)
If you prefer, rather than creating the file from scratch, you could download the lesson_1_reflections_prompts.txt file from the Downloadables section, place it in the reflections directory and rename it, then add your response after the first prompt.

Once you’ve saved your file, if you want to double-check that everything has gone as planned, try these commands:

pwd # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls  # list the files in this directory
If you're having trouble getting this working, videos at the end of the lesson called "Setting up Your Workspace on Windows" and "Setting Up Your Workspace on Mac" will demonstrate parts of this process, so you might want to wait until then. In the mean time, you can create the directories and file using your OS’s Graphical Interface for working with files (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc). It's good to get some practice using the command line, though, since we'll be using it a lot in this course, so once you've watched the workspace instructions, make sure you can complete actions like this on the command line.

You are also welcome to use a different naming scheme, but later in the course we will refer to this file structure and it will be up to you to translate to whatever naming scheme you chose instead!

Use short lines
Many command line tools, including Git, are less useful if your files contain very long lines. For example, if you use diff to compare two files that have all their content on the same line, diff will only show you that the two files are different. It will not be able to pinpoint the location of the difference for you.

For this reason, it is a good idea to make sure you keep your lines reasonably short when writing your reflections (or other plain-text files). The exact limit is a matter of personal preference. Many developers use a max line length of 80 to 120 characters. Some editors can automatically insert line breaks for you, but for others, like Sublime, you will need to remember to press enter when you want to create a new line.

Do the first reflection exercise
Populate lesson_1_reflections.txt with the following question and your thoughts on it:

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

When you've created your document, written down your thoughts, and saved the file, click "Next" to learn about some systems that can help you create these versions of your files.
Like Sarah said, there is a lot of research out there on reflection. If you want a quick intro with some neat graphics, check out this site.

For a more in-depth look, check out this seminal 20-page paper on the topic.

Reflect: Using History for Efficiency
Now that you've learned about some version control systems, and how they can help you save the history of a file, go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
