<h3>Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs</h3>

<h4>Make sure you can access the command line</h4>

<p>If you are on Windows, you’ll need to install some software in order to
use a unix-like command line (different from the Windows built-in
Command Prompt), as we mentioned previously. For more info, check out this page.</p>

<h4>Choose a text editor</h4>

<p>As noted in the previous video, you should make sure to use a simple text editor
like Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim, etc. and not a rich-text editor like
Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, so that you can easily look at your files' content
on the command line.
</p>

<p>If you don’t have one that you like yet, Sublime is a good option that will work on Windows,
Mac, and Linux. We have provided more detailed instructions for setting up Sublime than for
other editors, and we use Sublime for all the examples in the course. You can download Sublime here.
</p>

<h4>Make sure you can launch your editor from the command line</h4>
<p>It will be helpful to be able to launch your text editor from the command line.
See here for instructions on how to do this for Sublime. If you have trouble getting
this working, videos at the end of the lesson called "Setting up Your Workspace on 
Windows" and "Setting Up Your Workspace on Mac" will demonstrate this process, so
you can wait until then.
</p>

<h4>Set up your course workspace</h4>
<p>Right now, you should create a version-control directory (a more computer-science-y
term for “folder”) to hold all your files for this course in an easy to remember
location, then create a reflections sub-directory, and within that, create a plain
text file called lesson_1_reflections.txt for the questions from this lesson.
</p>

<p>You can do this by running the following commands in either Git Bash or the terminal
(the bits after the # signs are comments, anything after those are not interpreted):</p>

<p>
cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt
(you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)
If you prefer, rather than creating the file from scratch, you could download the
lesson_1_reflections_prompts.txt file from the Downloadables section, place it in the
reflections directory and rename it, then add your response after the first prompt.
</p>

#### 8. **Reflect: Using history for efficiency **:
```
Reflect: Using History for Efficiency
Now that you've learned about some version control systems, and how they can help you save the history of a file, go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

When you've updated your document, click "Next" to learn about some differences between these version control systems.
