# Task 8

### What you'll learn
* Export and download the course (backup)

### a)

Go to the Studio. Select **Tools** and then **Export**. Click **Export Course Content**.

The generated file contains the course content and structure, along with the course settings. Note: *It doesn't contain data about students, nor forum and wiki content.


By importing this file you'll restore the current version of the course. This works as a backup of what you've done so far. (In addition, AkademiX regularly performs complete backups of the entire server, of course).
