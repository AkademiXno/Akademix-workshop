## For producing e-learning videos

You'll find lots of good guides and resources online about producing e-learning videos. Here is our setups. We typically use relatively cheap "do-it-yourself" solutions. The most important ingredients is a tablet and a *good microphone*. 

## Simple setup

   * **Tablet**: The [Wacom Intuos Pro](http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos-pro) works well. The medium-sized version is approximately **EUR 340**.
   * **Table microphone**: We use the [Blue Yeti USB microphone](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/), priced at approximately **EUR 140**

## More advanced setup

   * **Tablet**: [Wacom Cintiq 22HD](http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/cintiq-22-hd). Approximately **EUR 1700**.
   * **Headset microphone and mixer**: This is necessary mainly for our mathematics courses. The table microphones tend to pick up "tapping" sounds from the tablet. Less so for headset-based microphones. We use the [Audio-Technica BPHS1](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/f36152d8a3580d50/) in combination with the USB mixer [Behringer XENYX 302USB](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/302USB/p/P0ADV). Approximate price: **EUR 200 + 50**.
   * **Webcam**: The [Logitech web cameras](https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/video/webcams) are nice. We use the C930e, which costs approximately **EUR 65**. 



# Recommended software

  * **PowerPoint**: If you normally use PowerPoint for your lectures, then it's easiest to turn your presentations into videos directly in PowerPoint: [Turn your presentation into a video](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83).
  * **Screen recorder**: With a screen recorder you can record a video from any software (f.ex. OneNote). We use the [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), which is free and open source. If you use PowerPoint, a separate screen recorder is not necessary (you can use PowerPoint's built-in screen recorder).
